# Muggsy Theme 

A theme maintained by Classic development containing both reusable code and a starting point for custom themes.


## Philosophy 

This project is intended to standardize the theming process and reduce the amount of duplication of effort that goes into development.

This project contains two themes in essence: 
*Muggsy* - sub-theme of [boron](http://drupal.org/project/boron) which intended to contain reusable code that can benefit sites that run on the Classic_distro. 
* *CUSTOMSTART* - a collection of directories and files which are meant to be **copied** to *sites/all/themes*, renamed according to the project, and then customized as needed.
