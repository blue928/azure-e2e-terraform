This folder is where you should place all your overriding template files. By
default, the Bootstrap base theme provides all the necessary template files in
various folders inside of profiles/classic/themes/bootstrap/templates. For example, the
page.tpl.php template file is located at
profiles/classic/themes/bootstrap/templates/system/page.tpl.php. To override any of these
files, copy them from the Bootstrap base theme and place them in here.
