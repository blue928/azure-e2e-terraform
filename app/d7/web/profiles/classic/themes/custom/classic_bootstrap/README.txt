Classic_bootstrap is a subtheme of the Drupal Bootstrap theme. Drupal Bootstrap is required to be installed as a base theme, but does not enabled.

Some features / requirements to use this theme:

	[1] You may use an SVG file for the theme logo, which is provided by default. You may replace the logo.svg file as needed.
	[2] This theme uses the Farbtastic module, as provided by Drupal 7 core. The implementation of this module allows an admin to override the default colors of main HTML elements provided by the LESS files.
	[3] DO NOT EDIT THE CSS FILES DIRECTLY. Use the LESS files to generate the CSS files.
	[4] The theme implements a jQuery keydown() function to expand the sidemenu. To expand or modify this functionality, see http://api.jquery.com/keydown. The specific code is in classic_bootstrap/js/classic.js.
	[5] A block or some content must be added to the side_menu region to display the sidemenu, which also contains the logo. This may (and probablty should) be changed soon.

	More to come.
